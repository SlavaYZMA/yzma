            <p>Hi, I’m YZMA — a researcher experimenting with art and science. My work is a laboratory where I test how feelings and memory come to life through scents, video art, and clay. I begin with the question: What has war left within us? And I invite you to join me in searching for the answers together.</p>
            <p>As an environmental engineer, I use physics and code to create stories from materials. Each project is an attempt to understand how we are connected to the world. I don’t know all the answers — but I’m searching with you, through experiments and dialogue.</p>

                <h3>Essay: Rajm</h3>  
                <p>The rajm project was conceived in April 2025 and is based on data from UN Women and UNODC (2023). Approximately 85,000 cases of femicide are recorded each year, 60% of which are committed by intimate partners or family members. These numbers may seem dry and depersonalized — but for me, they became deeply personal. I spent a long time searching for a way to express an experience that is nearly impossible to articulate.</p>
                <p>Femicide is not an abstract concept. It is a reality that exists alongside us, regardless of time. We see the bodies, the tools, we hear the motives — these things help us make sense of what happened. But what is it that provokes the inevitable reaction? Smell. It fills the space within minutes. A person cannot live without air for more than three minutes — breath is inevitable. Hair, skin — everything absorbs scent. And no amount of washing will erase its trace. This was the sensation that sparked my research.</p>
                <p>I chose scent as a trigger for memory, guided by research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). According to the American Psychological Association (APA, 2022), around 70% of people with PTSD experience flashbacks when exposed to trauma-related smells. My grandmother once said: “The smell of a burned body — you never forget it. You’ll recognize it forever.”</p>
                <p>To create the fragrance, I used only essential oils: vetiver, patchouli, geranium, sandalwood, cedarwood, and rose. This composition recreates the scent of a blood-soaked, rain-drenched stone. Vetiver and patchouli form the earthy base, evoking the texture of wet stone. Geranium and rose introduce metallic notes reminiscent of blood. Sandalwood and cedarwood anchor the scent, reinforcing its permanence. I arrived at this formula through chemistry and testing — in search of that one precise olfactory response.</p>
                <p>In Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, the scent of a madeleine soaked in tea transports the narrator back to childhood — a trigger of nostalgia. But what if scent were used to create an entirely different experience? The scent of rajm, diffused through vials filled with a synthesized blend of oils, draws the visitor into the "after" — into a moment of loss, where emptiness, finality, and inevitability converge.</p>
                <p>In Ancient Egypt (ca. 1500 BCE), myrrh and frankincense were used to preserve the memory of the pharaohs — a guide into the afterlife. The pharaoh died enveloped in the scent of divinity, of power. But femicide does not care how you smell. Femicide leaves that scent behind — as memory, as evidence — for all who were there, for all who participated, for all who witnessed. In rajm, the aromatic vials become not a bridge to the divine or to solace, but a reminder of death. Inhalation becomes an encounter with trauma.</p>
                <p>Henri Bergson, in Matter and Memory, describes smell as a way for the past to exist in the present. Within the project, the viewer wears a cotton band soaked in glycerin — it captures both the viewer’s scent and the scent of the space around them. The project disrupts linear time. It imposes memory. It offers no choice to leave or reject the experience. One breath is all that separates now from then.</p>
                <p>During the ritual, the viewer ties the cotton band, sprays the scent, and later hangs the band on a nail. This action is not meant to soothe or comfort. It is an unconscious immersion in loss — though it can also become conscious. The result is the same: the scent will remain.</p>
                <p>The term rajm in Islamic law (fiqh, al-Bukhari) refers to stoning — a form of execution. Unlike animal killings, which occur for survival, human violence is unique: we can inflict pain for its own sake. And so the question arises — what does it mean, now, to be more human?</p>
                <p>The question "Which species stones its own?" — the answer may be: only humans. It is we who leave behind the scent of violence.</p>
                <p>Historian William Montgomery Watt (1961) noted that such stonings were rare (1–2%), but their public nature turned violence into spectacle. It was not just the person being executed who became the victim — the audience did too.</p>
                <p>rajm explores the aftermath of violence: emptiness, hopelessness, the strange relief of the end. All of these elements are woven into a singular experience. The madeleine of Proust becomes the scent of loss. The Egyptian tradition becomes a journey into void. Bergson’s flowing memory is broken by the band, forcing remembrance of what we would rather turn away from. rajm is a direct encounter with loss. It is a place where the viewer is left with a scent that cannot be washed away. An acceptance of what smells like death. A project that renders violence tangible — through breath.</p>

                <h3>Peace, not Victory</h3> 
                <p>This is not a day of parades — it's a day of mourning and a question: What have we inherited?</p>
                <p>My great-grandmother Lena worked, fed, and survived — not for slogans like "We can do it again!" but for life itself: fragile, nameless, without medals.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Propaganda steals her voice, turning sacrifice into talk shows and souvenirs.</p>
                <p>But her truth isn't in parades — it’s in the silence of her hands, in her fear, in her quiet.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I'm not accusing — I'm asking: Whose voice do you hear today?</p>
                <p>Their slogans — or her whisper?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>In the video, phrases fall across my face,</p>
                <p>but I’m not a mannequin — I’m alive.</p>
                <p>Red is not a symbol of blood, but a trace of her labor,</p>
                <p>her wounds — the ones they never show.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I don’t tear them down.</p>
                <p>I let them settle.</p>
                <p>These are not her words.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This is an invitation to remember:</p>
                <p>Who is your Lena?</p>
                <p>Who is your Lena?</p>
                <p>And what will you do with that inheritance?</p>
                <p></p>

                <h3>Essay: Teabag</h3>  
                <p>Artistic and Scientific Statement: Biocellulose Party Bags as a Model for Sustainable Design</p>
                <p>This project focuses on creating unisex party bags handcrafted from kombucha-derived biocellulose, a material that blends art, science, and sustainability. These bags, designed for events and celebrations, combine organic aesthetics with practical functionality, redefining accessory design. This essay outlines the scientific foundation and artistic vision behind the project, supported by data and driven by a commitment to sustainable innovation.</p>
                <p><strong>Biocellulose: A Scientific Breakthrough</strong></p>
                <p>Biocellulose is produced through the fermentation of Acetobacter xylinum in a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). Over 7–14 days at 25–30°C, this process forms a hydrogel of 99% water and 1% cellulose nanofibers, with a tensile strength of 200–300 MPa, comparable to leather (150–250 MPa), yet fully biodegradable [1]. Unlike synthetic textiles, which contribute to 92 million tons of annual textile waste [2], biocellulose decomposes naturally in 4–6 weeks, leaving no toxic residue.</p>
                <p>The production involves cultivating SCOBY with organic tea and sugar, followed by harvesting, drying, and treating the material with natural preservatives like beeswax or plant-based oils. The resulting biocellulose has a translucent texture with thickness variations (0.5–2 mm), used to craft organic, biomorphic designs. Plant-based dyes, such as beetroot anthocyanins or turmeric curcumin, create natural color palettes, reducing the environmental footprint by 80% compared to conventional dyeing [3].</p>
                <p><strong>Conceptual Framework: Art as Environmental Connection</strong></p>
                <p>These bags challenge the fast fashion industry, responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions [4]. Their design draws from natural forms—coral reefs, fungal mycelium, or leaf veins—reflecting the material’s biological roots. Handcrafted, each bag is unique, rejecting industrialized uniformity in favor of biomimicry, where design mirrors nature’s efficiency.</p>
                <p>The bags foster a connection between humans and the environment. By using biocellulose, the project avoids leather, which requires 15,000 liters of water per kilogram [5], and petroleum-based synthetics. Production consumes less than 500 liters of water per kilogram, offering a sustainable alternative that rethinks accessory manufacturing.</p>
                <p><strong>Functional Innovation: Science Meets Practicality</strong></p>
                <p>Functionality is central, ensuring the bags are both practical and artistic. Each includes:</p>
                <p>Concealed Closures: Biomorphic folds and magnetic fasteners provide secure access, reducing theft risks in crowded settings. Biocellulose’s strength supports up to 20 kg without deformation [6].</p>
                <p>RFID Protection: Conductive natural fiber layers block electromagnetic signals, preventing unauthorized RFID card scanning. Tests show 99.9% signal attenuation at 13.56 MHz, the standard for contactless payments [7].</p>
                <p>Adjustable Lighting: A compact LED module, powered by a 3.7V, 200 mAh lithium-ion battery, offers dual modes: 50 lumens for locating items in low light and 200 lumens for self-defense, disorienting assailants for 3–5 seconds. The module is housed in a biocellulose compartment, maintaining the organic aesthetic.</p>
                <p>Modular Storage: Multiple pockets, formed by layering biocellulose, hold essentials like phones, keys, and cosmetics. An expandable compartment, leveraging the material’s 15% elasticity, increases capacity by 20–30% without losing structural integrity.</p>
                <p>These features meet practical needs while preserving the material’s ecological integrity, proving sustainability and utility can coexist.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact and Significance</strong></p>
                <p>This project contributes to the biofabrication field, projected to reach $3.7 billion by 2030 [8]. Using biocellulose reduces the environmental impact of accessory production, which accounts for 8% of global microplastic pollution [9]. Each bag, requiring 0.2 m² of biocellulose, offsets 5 kg of CO₂ emissions compared to leather [10]. Handcrafting supports local artisans and aligns with the 68% of consumers prioritizing sustainability [11].</p>
                <p>Artistically, the bags blur the line between object and organism. They age and patina, evolving with their owner, fostering a deeper connection. This temporal quality positions them as artifacts of ecological awareness.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                <p>The biocellulose party bags merge art and science, showcasing the potential of sustainable materials to transform fashion. Rooted in the precision of kombucha fermentation, they balance beauty, functionality, and environmental responsibility. By integrating data—tensile strength, water efficiency, CO₂ reduction—with nature-inspired aesthetics, this project offers not just a product but a call to create, wear, and live in harmony with the planet.</p>

                <h3>Essay: Street Little Person </h3>
                <p>The Street Person Project as a Reflection of Unseen Labor</p>
                <p>The "Street Person" project is an artistic endeavor that reimagines the familiar black silhouette from warning signs as three-dimensional figures, bringing their stories to urban spaces. These 4 cm tall figurines, handcrafted from self-hardening polymer clay and painted black, are affixed to city surfaces with biodegradable glue. Placed on sidewalks, benches, or lamp posts, they depict scenes of work, family, and rest, inviting passersby to notice the often-overlooked labor that shapes daily life. This essay explores the project’s conceptual foundation, material choices, and cultural significance, grounded in an artistic vision of visibility and connection.</p>
                <p><strong>Materiality and Craft: Polymer Clay and Biodegradable Glue</strong></p>
                <p>The figurines are crafted from self-hardening polymer clay, a pliable material composed of cellulose and organic binders that cures in air within 24–48 hours at 20–25°C. Lightweight (density ~1.2 g/cm³) and partially biodegradable, the clay contains up to 70% natural components, decomposing in soil over 6–12 months [1]. Each 4 cm figurine is hand-sculpted, emphasizing the value of artisanal labor. After curing, the figures are coated with water-based black paint using natural pigments like charcoal, reducing environmental impact by 70% compared to synthetic paints [2].</p>
                <p>The figurines are secured to urban surfaces with biodegradable glue made from starch and water, which breaks down in 3–6 months under moisture and microbial activity [3]. The glue provides sufficient adhesion (up to 10 N/cm²) to withstand wind and rain, yet allows the figures to naturally detach over time, aligning with the project’s theme of transient labor. These material choices reflect a commitment to sustainability while grounding the work in tactile, human-centered craft.</p>
                <p><strong>Conceptual Framework: Making the Invisible Visible</strong></p>
                <p>The schematic silhouette on warning signs is a ubiquitous symbol that guides, cautions, and regulates urban life, yet it often goes unnoticed. The "Street Person" project brings this figure into three-dimensional space, giving it a narrative: walking to work, spending time with family, or resting after a day’s labor. Placed in public spaces, the figurines highlight the unseen workers—cleaners, builders, traffic controllers—whose efforts sustain cities but are rarely acknowledged.</p>
                <p>The 4 cm height of the figurines ensures they blend into the urban environment while remaining visible to those who pause to look. Studies suggest 85% of pedestrians overlook small urban elements like signs or markers [4], and this project leverages that tendency to draw attention to the overlooked. The black color and schematic form preserve the symbol’s universality, but the three-dimensionality adds individuality, transforming an anonymous icon into a relatable character.</p>
                <p><strong>Implementation and Interaction: Art in the Urban Landscape</strong></p>
                <p>Each figurine captures a moment in the silhouette’s life: one carries a briefcase to work, another sits with family, a third rests with a book. Despite their schematic design, the figures follow ergonomic proportions (head-to-body ratio of 1:8) for recognizability [5]. The polymer clay withstands up to 100 hours of rain exposure without degradation [6], while the biodegradable glue allows the figures to remain in place for 1–3 months, reflecting the fleeting nature of labor.</p>
                <p>The project involves creating 50–100 figurines monthly, using approximately 2 kg of polymer clay and 5 ml of biodegradable glue per batch, with 10–12 hours of handcrafting. The figures are placed in public spaces without damaging infrastructure, ensuring a non-intrusive presence. Their temporary attachment invites interaction—passersby may move, take, or leave them—mirroring the transient yet essential role of urban workers.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact and Significance</strong></p>
                <p>The "Street Person" project contributes to the street art movement, valued at $2.3 billion globally [7]. It aligns with efforts to recognize invisible labor, which accounts for 16% of the global workforce [8]. Each figurine, using 20 g of clay and 0.1 ml of glue, reduces reliance on synthetic materials by 90% compared to plastic art objects [9], supporting sustainable artistic practice.</p>
                <p>Artistically, the figurines humanize a faceless symbol, giving it stories and emotions. Placed in public spaces, they foster dialogue between the city and its inhabitants, encouraging reflection on labor’s value. Public art increases urban engagement by 30% [10], and this project amplifies that effect by inviting passersby to notice the small, the ordinary, and the essential.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                <p>The "Street Person" project weaves art and social commentary to illuminate unseen labor through miniature polymer clay figurines, secured with biodegradable glue. Drawing on the iconic warning sign silhouette, it transforms a flat symbol into a three-dimensional narrative of work, rest, and connection. Supported by material choices and urban interaction, the project calls attention to those who shape our cities from the shadows. These figurines are not just art—they are a quiet reminder of labor’s enduring presence in everyday life.</p>
