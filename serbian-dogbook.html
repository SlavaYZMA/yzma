            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>Serbian Dog Small Talk was born from my personal experience: no matter where I moved, dogs always became a bridge to new connections. In Serbia, I noticed that dog owners are usually open to conversation — but the language barrier often prevents migrants from joining in easily.</p>
<p>I created this zine as a friendly translator — a small guide with key phrases, clear illustrations, and a touch of humor to help overcome that barrier and build relationships.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, I worked with both migrants and locals. Serbian residents helped refine the language, making it more accurate and warm, while migrants happily shared the zine with friends and picked up copies in cafés and bars.</p>
<p>The project became not only a practical tool but also a symbol of openness and inclusion, receiving joyful feedback from both sides.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The zine was entirely created by me — from concept and writing to illustrations and layout. It was printed at home in black and white, 6 pages long, with a total of 50 copies.</p>
<p>Each copy was manually folded, stitched, and trimmed — a time-consuming process that required careful attention to detail.</p>
<p>Distribution took place in migrant-friendly spots — bars and cafés — where the zine was made freely available to everyone.</p>
