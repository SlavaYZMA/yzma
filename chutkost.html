            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>What is sensitivity?</p>
            <p>It’s not just attentiveness to the world — it’s the ability to perceive its complexity with childlike curiosity and openness to the unfamiliar.</p>
            <p>"Sensitivity as a New Ecology" is a media installation by Vlada Ivanova (YZMA), Irina Danilicheva, Alexandra Dalibakh, and Yana Sorokina that returns the viewer to the world of childhood games, where every small thing gains meaning.</p>
            <p>The installation draws inspiration from the ritual of creating "secret treasures" — small hidden spots filled with precious finds.</p>
            <p>Its centerpiece is a coconut wax box that holds an abstracted memory of a meaningful Zenit football match, where the trajectories of the players are translated into points of light — a shimmering echo of a half-forgotten memory.</p>
            <p>This interactive object can be opened, touched, smelled — revealing the scent of grass.</p>
            <p>The wax responds to the warmth of human touch, gradually dissolving, symbolizing the fragility of the world under human influence. Nearby, interviews with football fans invite visitors to reflect on sensitivity and ecology, strengthening the connection between the two.</p>
            <p>Interacting with the installation reimagines ecology as the care for what is fragile.</p>
            <p>Childlike wonder and attentiveness become the foundation of a new mindset, where every gesture carries responsibility for the surrounding world.</p>
            <p>The project’s website complements this with materials on eco-habits, trends, and accessible challenges for everyone.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The creation of "Sensitivity" began with research on themes of will and control, and on social and ecological zones where a football player becomes an icon, and leaving the field becomes a metaphor for the impossibility of ignoring problems.</p>
<p>The concept of "Sensitivity as a New Ecology" is rooted in the old tension between humans and nature — reimagined through speculative and fantastical ideas.</p>
<p>The metaphor of a battery — the accumulation of feelings — became the foundation for the interactive box.</p>
<p>The artists experimented with different grass heights as a reflection of playing styles, explored tribal comfort (both emotional and physical), and the process of growing up — where we forget how to be sensitive.</p>
<p>Interviews with football players and fans, filmed as micro-documentaries, brought living voices into the installation.</p>
<p>Working with coconut wax and light-based trajectory mapping required precise calculations and extensive testing over several months.</p>
